# Clicky for Windows â€” Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Ollama installed (https://ollama.com) â€” for student/free mode
- A vision model pulled: `ollama pull qwen2.5vl:3b`

## Install

```bash
cd clicky-windows

# Student version (free, no API keys needed)
pip install -r requirements-student.txt

# Full version (all providers)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **PyAudio on Windows** may need: `pip install pipwin && pipwin install pyaudio`

## Configure

```bash

# Edit .env and add any API keys you have

The Clicky icon appears in your system tray.
